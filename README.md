# ADLabDevOpsProj

In this repo I automated the provisioning of an Active Directory Lab (in Azure using terrafrom) that consists of a DC and clients joined to the domain (using Ansible).


### Purpose of this proj:
I needed a way to easily create my lab enviroment after testing and messing up the lab with MDM policies, Defender settings, etc

### Looking for something complete and better maintained?
 Check christophetd/Adaz


### Future Plan:
- Find a way to hybrid join the devices to AAD in IaC. Need to automate AD connect settings.
- Onborad devices to defender.
